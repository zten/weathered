weathered
=========

An attempt by me (zten) and iann to do something fun with weather data from NOAA in the ISD-Lite file format.

For information about the format, and links to the weather data itself, check out http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/isd/index.php?name=isd-lite

Currently in development is the back-end support for mirroring the weather data and loading it into MongoDB. After that, we hope to do some fun visualization work and present it to people as a webapp.
